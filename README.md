Design Intent

TURAS has helped to develop a QR code mobile first website to access information relating to the Green Room concept in Stuttgart. The website can be accessed by scanning a QR code with a mobile device. This mobile first responsive website is built with CSS, HTML, and Javascript to resemble a standalone app. It uses the latest CSS animations and Javascript to add fluid movement and everything will be loaded on a single page using AJAX to make it feel like an app. It uses scalable vector graphics to ensure that the icons and logo are perfectly crisp on every screen resolution.


Principal Elements

The Green Living Room is a mobile first responsive website. The purpose of the application is to disseminate ideas and information relating the Green Room project. It does so through 6 primary actions:

1. Introduction – users are presented with contextual information related to the project and a range of images.
2. Video – a promotional video was completed to demonstrate the green room project in action
3. Data – Heatmap data measurements of the surfaces of the green living room and the surroundings, illustrating the change from blue in the morning to red in the afternoon and back to green / blue in the night
4. 3D Model – users can view the 3D green room model, pan, and navigate through the 3D environment.
5. Information – Links to dissemination materials and links to information about green infrastructure
6. Contact - relevant info about project partners
